## Purpose
MachoBins is designed to provide information on Mac lolbins, similar to https://gtfobins.github.io/ or https://lolbas-project.github.io/, but specifically for Mac! 

I am very open to contributions, so please feel free to put in a pull request or open issues here to let me know of any Mac lolbins which aren't listed.  I will do my best to respond/incorporate to legitimate suggestions.  To borrow from the aforementioned projects, a legitimate contribution must:

Be an Apple-signed file, either native to the OS or downloaded from Apple.
Have extra "unexpected" functionality. It is not interesting to document intended use cases - Exceptions are application whitelisting bypasses.
Have functionality that would be useful to an APT or red team.

Interesting functionality can include:

Executing code
Arbitrary code execution
Pass-through execution of other programs (unsigned) or scripts (via a LOLBin)
Compiling code
File operations
Persistence
Credential theft
Dumping process memory
etc.


Thanks for your contributions!
